## Introduction

This project is something that I work on in my spare time or when I am feeling like coding.
I am trying to casually work on this and not worry about deadlines or anything alont those line.

## Folder Structure

Here is a small description about the folders in this project:

- `src`: the folder to maintain all of the code
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `db` : the folder to maintain the databases created

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
